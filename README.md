# ChatCore
ChatCore is a shared chat client library written in .NET Standard 2.0. The main objective behind this project is to reduce overhead in situations where multiple assemblies may want to interact with the same chat services (this is most useful with game modifications that have several significant chat integrations).

# Basic Setup
Check out the included [Test Project](https://github.com/brian91292/ChatCore/blob/develop/ChatCoreTester/) for a basic example of how to start the ChatCore services.
